    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cream Cheese Italian Pinwheels â€“ A pinwheel appetizer filled with cream cheese, ham, salami, banana pepper rings, shredded lettuce, and Italian dressing.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 oz. cream cheese room temperature</li>
        <li>4 large (10 inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>9 oz. deli ham thinly sliced</li>
        <li>7 oz. hard salami thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup drained banana pepper rings</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded lettuce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. Italian dressing</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Divide the cream cheese among the tortillas. Spread the cream cheese in a thin layer to cover the tortillas.</li>
        <li>Add thin layers of ham and salami, covering half of each tortilla.</li>
        <li>Spread the banana pepper rings in a line down the middle of the tortilla, along the edge of the meat.</li>
        <li>Add the lettuce and Italian dressing to a bowl. Mix until the lettuce is evenly coated.  Spread the lettuce evenly over the meat.</li>
        <li>Starting with the end that has the toppings, roll up the tortillas as tightly as you can.</li>
        <li>Tightly wrap the rolls in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 30-60 minutes (no longer, 45 minutes is the sweet spot).</li>
        <li>Remove the plastic wrap. Slice each roll into 12 pieces, making 48 pinwheels.</li>
        <li>Line a platter with paper towels.  Arrange the pinwheels evenly on the platter and serve immediately (the paper towels prevent the tortilla from getting soggy).</li>
    </ol>
